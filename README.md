Subject: Leave of 15 days in Computer Class for College Terminal Examination

Respected Sir,

I am writing this letter to request you to grant me a leave of 15 days in the computer class for my college terminal examination. I am a student of your institute, studying in the final year of Computer Science.

As you know, the college terminal examination is approaching, and I need to focus on my studies to score well in the examination. I need to practice computer programming and other related activities in the computer class, which will help me to prepare well for the examination.

I understand that this is a busy time for the institute and I will not be able to attend the classes for 15 days. However, I will keep myself updated with the lectures and other activities through the online classes and other resources. I will also try to complete the assignments and other activities to the best of my abilities.

I humbly request you to kindly grant me a leave of 15 days in the computer class for my college terminal examination. I assure you that I will make up for the classes once the exams are over.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
